# Snakegame-
The snake game has simple functions. It starts at the left top corner of the frame heading towards any direction that user wants it to move. Snake eats appleas and each apple eaten increases the lenght of snake body. Snake will die as well as the game if the snake bites its body parts or any wall around the frame. Each eaten apple increases the score. And score can go infinitely.

During building this game the most challenge was setting the start location of the snake and fixing the apples from appearing randomly on the top of body parts of a snake. But its been fixed and all is working perfectly.
